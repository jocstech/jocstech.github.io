##Introduction
In computer-based language recognition, **ANTLR** (pronounced Antler), or Another Tool For Language Recognition, is a parser generator that uses LL(*) parsing. ANTLR is the successor to the Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set (PCCTS), first developed in 1989, and is under active development. Its maintainer is Professor Terence Parr of the University of San Francisco.
